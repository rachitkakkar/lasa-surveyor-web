        <h1>Background:</h1>
<p>The LASA Surveyorâ€™s first survey for 2023-2024 was released from October 2nd to 16th and received 95 responses. The survey covered summer activities as well as basic school life.</p>
<h1>Summer Activities:</h1>
<p>Slightly half of the students traveled out of Texas, and 31% traveled out of the country. Only a small percentage (around 3%) did not leave Austin at all.
<img src="../../img/posts/5/1.png" alt="Travel"></p>
<p>The countries and states which students traveled to can be viewed in the maps below:
<img src="../../img/posts/5/summer_countries_visited.png" alt="Countries">
<img src="../../img/posts/5/summer_states_visited.png" alt="States"></p>
<p>The majority of students traveled for recreation, and half traveled to visit family and friends. Over a quarter traveled specifically for an academic/work-related reason.
<img src="../../img/posts/5/2.png" alt="Reason"></p>
<p>The majority of students (around two-thirds) did not work or intern over the summer.

<p>The majority of students also did not take a summer class for highschool or college credit.

<h1>School:</h1>
<p>Students were evenly split between the different sports, with the most playing volleyball, followed by track, swim/drive, and cross country. No respondent participated in football, wrestling, or lacrosse (and thus they were omitted from the graph).
<img src="../../img/posts/5/5.png" alt="Sports"></p>
<p>In terms of fine arts, slightly over a third of students were in art, followed by orchestra and band.
<img src="../../img/posts/5/6.png" alt="Fine Arts"></p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that slightly less than half of the students answered that they participated in a fine art or sport.</p>
<p>Around 44% of students had some sort of preference for A-days, compared with 46% for B-days. The remaining group had no preference.
<img src="../../img/posts/5/7.png" alt="Day Preference"></p>
<p>Students were also split among what they thought was the easiest core, although the two pluralities were English and Math respectively.
<img src="../../img/posts/5/8.png" alt="Easy Core"></p>
<p>Over half of the students agreed that science was their hardest core subject, followed by social studies.
<img src="../../img/posts/5/9.png" alt="Hard Core"></p>
<p>A plurality of students (slightly less than half) spent 1-2 hours on homework, followed by roughly a quarter that spent 2-3 hours.
